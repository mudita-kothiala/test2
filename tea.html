<h1>Tea recipe</h1><br>
<h3>Equipment</h3>
<p>Stainless steel pot (ideally reserved exclusively for making tea to avoid other flavors)</p>
<p>Ladled Spoon</p>
<p>Tea Strainer</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <p>Water, 1 cup</p>
<p>Green Cardamom Pods, 5, smashed</p>
<p>Peppercorns, 2-3, smashed</p>
<p>Loose Black Tea Leaves, 4 tsp Wagh Bakri or Tata Chakra Gold are my favorite loose CTC teas; The Chai Box and One Stripe Chai Co make some wonderful blends with spices already in it!</p>
<p>Milk, 1 1/4 cup I use 2% Lactaid milk; if using whole milk, you maybe want to reduce the amount added to about 1 cup; for dairy-free chaya, check out my dairy-free recipe</p>
<p>Sugar, 2 tsp</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
 
<p>Boil the tea.</p>
<p>In a steel pot, bring the water, smashed cardamom, and smashed peppercorns to a boil. Allow to boil for 2-3 minutes so the spices steep the water.</p>
<p>Now add the loose black tea leaves. Let brew for about 2-3 minutes. Stir every 20-30 seconds to prevent the tea from sticking.</p>
<p>Do not overboil the loose black tea leaves or it will taste bitter.</p>
<p>Boil the tea with milk.</p>
<p>Now pour in the milk.</p>
<p>Once the milk is poured in, stir every so often. Use a ladle spoon to pour and swirl the tea leaves in the pot.</p>
<p>Bring the tea to such a rumbling boil that it foams up nearly to the top of your pot.</p>
<p>Just as it reaches the very top of the pot, turn the heat to medium low and let the tea rumble for another 20-30 seconds to deepen the flavor of the milk and tea.</p>
<p>Strain and cool.</p>
<p>Strain the tea into a large, thin-rimmed mug.</p>
<p>Pour the mug of tea from a low to high height into your drinking cup to create a frothy top and cool down your tea. Done!</p>
